Install GO:
===========
- downlaod golang: 
             https://golang.org/dl/
- copy downloaded golang repo to /usr/local/
- set GOROOT: 
             GOROOT is go installation directory(where go binary is present) 
             i.e. /usr/local/go/bin
         export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

- set GOPATH : 
             GOPATH is environment variable which specifies the location of your workspace(working directory) 
             i.e. directory where go code is stored. 
             It defaults to a directory named go inside your home directory, so $HOME/go on Unix
         export GOPATH=/usr/sheel/go 
                                    where $HOME is home directory for user "sheel".





$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello
       write program in hello.go inside hello directory.
$ build and install program : 
      go install github.com/user/hello : It will create binary hello file at same location.
      go build  github.com/user/hello  : It will create hello binary file in $GOPATH/bin/hello
      
$ run program: $GOPATH/bin/hello
               or  
               $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello

GO Project code structure inside /home/sheel/go:
-----------------------------------------------
bin/
    hello                 # command executable
src/
    github.com/user/
        helloMain/
            hello.go      # command source
        helloUtil/
            util.go       # package source
