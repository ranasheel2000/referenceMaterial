Install GO:
===========
- downlaod golang: 
             https://golang.org/dl/
- copy downloaded golang repo to /usr/local/
- set GOROOT: 
             GOROOT is go installation directory(where go binary is present) 
             i.e. /usr/local/go/bin
         export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

- set GOPATH : 
             GOPATH is environment variable which specifies the location of your workspace(working directory) 
             i.e. directory where go code is stored. 
             It defaults to a directory named go inside your home directory, so $HOME/go on Unix
         export GOPATH=/usr/sheel/go 
                                    where $HOME is home directory for user "sheel".
