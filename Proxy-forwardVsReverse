Forward Proxy and Reverse proxy are just different format of proxy and easy to identify depending upon place where proxy is used.
If proxy is used at client side-it is forward proxy.
If proxy is used at server side-it is reverse proxy.

Forward Proxy: It is at the end of client - intermediary that the client puts forward between itself and any server. 
               The forward proxy is the intermediary on the client side of the internet.
               
               For ex, server which provides internet access to users on firewall-restricted network.
               User sends a connection request to forward proxy and the forward proxy inturn retrieves data from the internet.
               It usually lets users on an firewall-restricted network to access the internet.

Reverse proxy: It is at the end of server – intermediary that the server puts forward between itself and any client.
               The reverse proxy is an intermediary on the server side of the internet. 
               This is an intermediary point between a web server’s back-end and the client.
               
               For ex, server which provides loadbalancing to the client requests. 
               (loadbalancer server decides, using reverse proxy, which server will serve client's request)
               A server owner can use a reverse proxy and hide the rest of it's servers behind a firewall that is only accessible via the reverse proxy. 
               client will see the reverse proxy as the target server, client does not know which server will serve to its request actually.
               Reverse proxy is generally used to improve website/server speed by keeping cache content on reverse proxy.
