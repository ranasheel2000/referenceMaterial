Reverse proxy: It is at the end of server – intermediary that the server puts forward between itself and any client.
               The reverse proxy is an intermediary on the server side of the internet. 
               This is an intermediary point between a web server’s back-end and the client.
               For ex, server which provides loadbalancing to the client requests. 
                       Client does not know which server will serve to its request. 
                       (loadbalancer server decides, using reverse proxy, which server will serve client's request)
