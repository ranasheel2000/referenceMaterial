## ① ～させてください

### （使役形＋ください：許可を強く求める）

### Example

**早く帰らせてください。**

> Please allow me to go home early.

**ちょっと気分が悪いので、早く帰らせてください。**

> I’m not feeling well, so please let me go home early.

---

### Grammar form

V（ない形）→ ないを取る → させる → させてください
帰る → 帰らせてください

* Asking **permission for your own action**
* More **polite and formal**
* Often used when:
  * Speaking to a **superior**
  * At **work / school**
  * You feel you need a **good reason**

📌 Compared with ～てもいいですか, this sounds:
* More careful

## ② ～てもいいですか

### （カジュアル～丁寧：許可）

**体調があまり良くないので、早く帰ってもいいですか？**

> I’m not feeling well—may I go home early?

### Meaning

* “Is it okay if I…?”

* **服を忘れたので、早く帰ってもいいですか？**

---
