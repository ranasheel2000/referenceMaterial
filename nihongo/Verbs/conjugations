3 types of verbs:
   
1.Ichidan verbs
-----------------
Ichidan verbs have 1 stem form (hence ichidan):
strip off the る, and there you have it. 
You use that stem form for basically every conjugation.

2. Godan verbs
----------------   
Godan verbs have 5 stem forms (hence godan):
1 for each column of the kana table, ending in each respective vowel.
So for a godan verb like 行く, the stems are
行か - used with for instance the negative form 行かない
行き - used with for instance the polite form 行きます (and many others - this is sort of the “generic noun” form of a verb, and will often be referred to as the “masu stem”, and is more formally known as the renyokei)
行く - this is just the dictionary form
行け - used with for instance the potential form 行ける
行こ - used with for instance the volitional form 行こう

For an ichidan verb like 食べる however, the stem form is just 食べ for all of those:

食べない
食べます
食べる
食べられる
食べよう


Nidan verbs have 2 stem forms, hence nidan.
Nidan verbs are a little different and their
conjugation patterns have been replaced with
the ichidan conjugation patterns, but they come
in two types: 
- kami (upper) nidan verbs, with a stem ending in -i and a stem ending in -u,
and
- shimo (lower) nidan verbs, with a stem ending in -e and a stem ending in -u.
But if you’re going to conjugate those you’ll end up 
with entirely different forms anyway, since even 
the conjugations themselves are different in classical
Japanese.

Also interesting to know: the kami/shimo distinction also
exists for ichidan verbs, and refers to ichidan 
verbs ending in -iru and -eru respectively (or more accurately, stems ending in -i or -e). 
As you might expect, these stems are just the respective stems
of the original nidan verb.
(so 起く for instance, being a kami nidan verb, had its stem form 起き turn into the ichidan verb 起きる, 
whereas 上ぐ, a shimo nidan verb, had its stem form 上げ turn into the ichidan verb 上げる).
